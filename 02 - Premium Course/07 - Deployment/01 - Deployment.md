## Deployment and Congrats!

Alright, congrats on finishing the Premium course!

So, if we want to see all the changes that we made in this course, we already set up the Netlify deployment in the last course. And since it's synced to the GitHub repository, every time you push it will trigger a new deployment on your Netlify site.

So, let's check and make sure the deployment is working, and that the website looks good.

Let's go to Netlify.com, and log in to your account, and we used "Log in with GitHub" last time, so we'll click that button. And, if you're logged into your GitHub account, it should be able to log you into Netlify.

Here's the dashboard-- yours probably looks different from mine since I have some other random sites here. But in the "Sites" list you should be able to see the Responsive Design Website, and its randomized name.

If you click on it, it will load the dashboard for that specific site. And you can click the link to load the actual website.

Alright, here's the website, and it does seem to have the changes that we made in this course-- the Top Navigation has the gradient underlines, the Hero section has the wave image, we have the new Alternating Features section, the updated Testimonial section with the 2 quotation mark symbols, and the Full-width CTA has the simple form that we added.

And let's also check the mobile version. In Responsive Design Mode I'll select iPhone, and scroll down the site. And everything looks pretty good!

So, we've finished and deployed the Premium website. Now what? Well, if you've bought the last course, the Ultimate course, then you can continue on with that one. And if you aren't sure how to get there, I have the link to it down below.

Now, if you haven't bought the Ultimate course because you've been buying the courses individually, and you need an upgrade, you can buy the Ultimate course by itself by going to the same link below.

Alright, see you in the Ultimate course!
