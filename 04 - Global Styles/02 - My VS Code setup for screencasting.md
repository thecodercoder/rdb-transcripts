# VS Code settings

Before we start with the Global Styles, I wanted to show you a couple of things that I'm doing with my VS Code setup for screencasting purposes.

So as you can see here, we have VS Code on the left, and the website on the right, because I wanted you to be able to see both the code and the website at the same time. However, things are looking pretty cramped.

So in order to save some space and make it easier for you all to view, I'm going to hide the left sidebar, called the primary sidebar. You can do that by going up at the top and click the first layout looking icon, "Toggle Primary Side Bar". Or you can use the shortcut Ctrl-B on Windows, or Command-B on Macs..

And I'm also going to hide the far left Activity Bar, since we don't use it that often. If you right-click in the bar, you can select "Hide Activity Bar". And I actually bound that to a new keyboard shortcut, Ctrl-Alt-B.

You can create custom shortcuts in VS Code if you go to File, Preferences, Keyboard Shortcuts. Or on Macs, it's at Code, Preferences, Keyboard Shortcuts.

In the search bar type "Activity", and we want to look for "Toggle Activity Bar". Click the pencil "Edit" icon and type in Ctrl-Alt-B or Command-Alt-B for Macs, or another combination that you'd prefer. I've already bound that shortcut to toggling the Activity Bar.

So now, if I press Ctrl-Alt-B, I can hide the Activity Bar, and Ctrl-B will let us hide and show the Primary Sidebar.

And I've also bound another keyboard shortcut. If you search for "Copy line down", by default it's "Shift + Alt + DownArrow" but I'm clicking that Edit pencil and then binding it to "Ctrl + D", or for Macs you could use "Command + D". I use this command a lot, so I wanted it to be something easy to press.

In addition, in Firefox, I've set the Developer Tools, to be in its own separate window instead of on the left or right side. You can select this if you click on the three dots on the top right.

So now, all the code, whether it's in the Firefox Dev Tools, or VS Code, will be on the left, and the website will be on the right.

And, in VS Code, I'm going to be running the "Live Sass" and "Live Server" extensions down in the Terminal panel, but keeping it small so we have more real estate for the code.

Alright, now let's get into the real stuff.
