# Study the design

In this video we're going to start adding some global styles to the website. By global styles, I mean things that will be reused throughout the website, not just limited to one section of the site. For example, font styles, colors, and layout styles like spacing and containing the content to 1200px wide.

When I start building a website from a design, what I'll usually do is look at the design and see how things are set up design-wise. So let's go to Figma and do that now, and take a look starting from the top and working our way to the bottom.

So up at the top we have our navigation bar, with the logo on the left and links on the right. Then under the navigation, we have our hero section.

The term "hero" is an advertising term that refers to the top section of a website that displays the most important content, either explaining what the company is all about or promoting a current marketing campaign.

In this website we have a two-column hero on desktop with text and buttons on the left, and an image on the right. And on mobile this two-column layout gets stacked to 1 column with the image first, then the text below it.

Under the hero is a features section that's 3 columns on desktop and 1 column on mobile. And there are some icon images for each feature block.

Under that, we have a Full-width Feature section with text and an image. Using these solid color images seems to be a trend nowadays.

One benefit of this style of illustration is that they are less complex than a photographed image and can be exported as PNGs or SVGs which will have a smaller file size than if you exported them as a JPG. This will help your website to load faster, and it's one reason why I think these illustrations are popular right now.

Under the Full-width Feature section is a quote or testimonial section, with a quotation mark image, the quote text, and author picture and information. On mobile the content is stacked to 1 column, with the author photo and author information centered.

Then, we have a Full width CTA or "call to action" section. This is part of a website marketing strategy, where your entire website is promoting the company and trying to get you to purchase something from them.

Most of the website content is telling you about the product, and at the bottom of the website, they are trying to get you to take some kind of action based on what you've seen. In our case here we are trying to get the user to click the "Free Trial" button and sign up for that.

The layout is basically the same between desktop and mobile, with both versions having the content in 1 column and everything centered. The trickiest part about this section is the background, which is a linear gradient. It looks slightly different between desktop and mobile, where on mobile the right side doesn't go as light as the right side on desktop.

Then under the CTA section is the footer, which contains the logo again, and then 4 columns of links on the desktop design. On mobile, the content is split in 2 columns.

So that's just a first look at the design. I like doing this before I start to code so I can get a quick overview of what I have to do, and also identifying what areas of the website might be more challenging or time-consuming to build.
