# GitHub commits

Before we start building our website, let's take a look at GitHub Desktop, to make sure that we are ready to start committing our code. So go ahead and open up GitHub Desktop and open the repository that you created earlier for the course project. Mine is called "responsive design beginners."

There are probably going to be a lot of changes in the "Changes" tab. Most of them are going to be the new Sass files and other code changes that we made.

If you scroll down, you might see some changes to the style.css and CSS map file in the "dist" folder.

Now, let's go back to GitHub Desktop and talk about making commits. When you're using Git to track your code changes, you need to figure out how often you want to make a commit to save your progress. You don't want to wait until the very end when you've completely finished coding the entire website, and make one giant commit.

This is because, as we mentioned earlier in this course, using Git is like keeping save points in your code history. The more save points you have the easier it will be to revert back to a previous version. If you only have 1 giant save point, then you can only go back to the very very beginning, which won't help you very much.

So, you want to make commits regularly while you're coding, but you also don't need to make a commit every time you change a line of code, because that can just be too much.

I usually try to make commits whenever I have finished what feels like a complete little step in development. Or if I write some code that I'm not completely confident about, which I might need to revert in the future. In this course, I'll be showing you when I make commits as I build this website, so you can see how often I commit. And then you can decide for yourself how often you want to commit your code.

Let's make a commit to save all the changes we've created so far. In GitHub Desktop, check over the changed files one final time to make sure that there's nothing getting committed that we don't want. And then I think everything looks fine.

Alright, once you've checked your files and you're good to go, in the bottom left corner, type in a commit message-- you can choose whatever you want. I'm going to say "Project setup and intro" since all the files we've created so far have been in the project setup and intro to Sass and responsive design sections.

Then click the "commit to main" button and your commit should be created! Now if you click in the "History" tab, you can see the commits that you have made so far. You might see one commit that says "Initial commit," and if you do, it's probably from GitHub Desktop generating the start files when you created the repository-- it will automatically make this commit for you.

And then we have the commit that we just created. I'm also going to publish the repository on GitHub since we haven't done that yet. Up until now, the repository has only existed on our local computer. Once we publish, it will also exist up as a remote repository on GitHub. And this will make it accessible by other developers and when we deploy the website to a production server.

Once the repository is published, when you're making future commits, the button will let you "push" your changes to "origin", meaning the remote repository on GitHub.

You don't always have to push every time you make a commit. For me, I'll push my changes up to the remote repository either at the end of the day at work, or if another developer needs to check out code changes that I've made.

I'm just gonna uncheck it, so it'll be public, and then I'm going to click Publish Repository.

Once the repository is published, we can check that everything is there by loading GitHub.com and clicking on repository, and then
loading the repository.

So you can see here we have all the files and folders. Everything looks pretty good. And it tells us that this commit was made just two minutes ago. So this is the commit that we just pushed up here.

If everything seems like it's working, then you should be good to go! In the next section we'll be going into our code and adding a favicon to our website.
