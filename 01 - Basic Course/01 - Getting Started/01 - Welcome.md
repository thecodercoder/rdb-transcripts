# Welcome!

Hey everyone, welcome to Responsive Design for Beginners. Thank you so much for joining, and I
sincerely hope that this course will help you on your web developer journey.

So to start off, what's in this course, and what's the best way for you to go through it?

Well, Responsive Design for Beginners is actually made up of three courses, Basic, Premium, and Ultimate.

You're currently in the Basic course. I'll start by showing you how to get set up with the tools that you'll need, like VS Code and the GitHub Desktop app.

And then I'll take you through a crash course in Sass and Responsive Design, where we build a demo website using Sass.

After that, we'll be using those same project files to start building the basic website from a custom Figma design. Now, even though this course is geared for beginners, and I do explain every step, I do recommend learning at least the basics of HTML and CSS before taking this.

Now, if you're not sure where your skill level is in comparison with a course, you can try to just start going through it. And then if you find yourself being really lost, you may want to pause the course and then learn the basics before trying again.

I have some free resources linked down below this video, where you can learn HTML and CSS, or just get a refresher.

All right, so when you're going through the course, I highly recommend not just passively watching the videos, but trying to follow along in your own code editor.

At some points in the course, I'll give you the opportunity to pause the video and then try things for yourself first. And then when you wanna see my solution, you can resume the video to see how I did it, and you can even pause the course at any point if you wanna try figuring something out yourself first.

Another tip that'll help you learn is that if I mention a term or a property that you're not familiar with, I would encourage you to write it down so that you can research it later on. And if you have any questions or you get stuck on anything as you're going through this course, you can always post a message in the Discord community. The invite link should be right above this video.

And lastly, a note on Figma. Unfortunately, halfway through recording the course, Figma changed their UI so that the Inspect tab, which used to be in the right sidebar, was moved into what they're calling Figma Dev Mode.

Right now, Dev Mode is free and in open beta test, but from what I've heard, Adobe, which acquired Figma, is going to eventually make Dev Mode a paid product. Since I want you to be able to use Figma for free, I'm not gonna be using Dev Mode in this course.

But only the regular free design mode. So because of this, there are a few instances in the course where I did use the old Inspect tab to copy some CSS style rules. Fortunately, I didn't do it that often, and where I did, I've now added some text notes above the video player telling you how to work around that.

I also re-recorded some parts of videos to use the new Figma UI. So there are a few places where you may still see the old Inspect tab in the videos, but if you do, please ignore it. And I hope it doesn't cause any confusion.

All right, that's it for the intro, let's get into the course.
